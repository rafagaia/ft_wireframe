# Ft_WireFrame

# Overview:
(ft_fdf: Fils de Fer) is about creating a 3D map of a Relief Landscape, generated from a file containing (X,Y,Z) coordinates. We then render the points connected by lines, allowing visualization through rotation, and translation of the map.

# [TODO] In-Progress:

	0. Add Keyboard and Mouse Handlers
	1. Prepare .fdf data onto List of Pixels
	2. Implement ft_libgfx functions:
	2.1 ft_putpixel
	2.2 ft_putline
	2.3 ft_render_fdf.c
